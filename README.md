# 🚀 LeetUp — LeetCode Grind

Welcome to **LeetUp** — my personal playground for **DSA, algorithms, and coding patterns**!  
Here, I solve LeetCode problems **in multiple languages** (Java, C++, Python) and track learnings for every problem.  

Each problem folder is self-contained and includes:

- Multi-language solutions 📝  
- Notes & insights 💡  
- Optional README with problem description 📄  

**Goal:** Build intuition, solve efficiently, and have a **ready-to-use coding reference**.
