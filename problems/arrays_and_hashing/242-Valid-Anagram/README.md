# 217. Contains Duplicate

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

### Example
```
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
```

```
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
```

### Recommended Solution
- **Approach:** 
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n is the length of the string s and m is the length of the string t.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
